# router-services-middleware Node Example

This example is a [Node.js server](https://nodejs.org/) that handles routing using `@remix-run/fetch-router` with additional features provided by `@remix-run/fetch-router-extra` and `@remix-run/router-services-middleware`.

This example only shows the basic usage of `@remix-run/router-services-middleware` and how to infer the service type from the router and provide it to the router. For more common use cases, see the [complete example](../complete/README.md).
